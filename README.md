Repository of all the small projects: 

1. humanizer-tool : How the Tool Works
The tool uses several techniques to make AI content sound more human:

Contractions: Converts formal phrases like "it is" to conversational "it's"
Casual vocabulary: Replaces formal words with everyday alternatives
Sentence restructuring: Combines or splits sentences for a more natural flow
Personality markers: Adds filler words and expressions that humans naturally use
Variable emphasis: Occasionally adds emphasis where appropriate

Customizing the Tool (Optional)
If you have HTML/JavaScript knowledge, you can modify the tool by:

Opening the HTML file in a code editor
Adding new word replacements in the addInformality() function
Adding new personality markers in the addPersonality() function
Creating new preset combinations in the applyPreset() function
Changing the styling in the CSS section at the top
